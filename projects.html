                <p>The product focuses on creating a solution to prevent toddlers from falling into the trap of being a victim of sexual child abuse. The mentioned problem is resolved by real-time tracking of the bloomer, giving extensive control to the
                    parents in setting the relaxation time of the bloomer, and complete transparency and the network status of the bloomer.
                    <br> The USP of the proposed idea is real-time tracking of the toddler, the Number of loo breaks by the toddler, and variable relaxation time provided to the parents.

                <p>Smart organizer for dry groceries is an IoT-based architectural solution to organize dry groceries in the kitchen based on the days until expiry to avoid food-borne diseases due to consumption post-expiry date. The proposed system has
                    two components, the IoT device, and a web console.<br> The lid of the grocery container has an RFID tag to uniquely identify the container and read by the device to fetch the required details. The proposed device displays information
                    regarding the grocery, such as the name of the grocery, manufacturing date, days until expiry, and estimated quantity leftover in the container. The backend is a real-time database hosted in the cloud, which acts as a centralized repository
                    for the IoT device and web console. The web console assists in fetching the required information about the grocery to the cloud-based backend.</p>

                <p>One of the most crucial aspects of a teaching faculty is to correct the answer sheets of the students. With a curriculum driven by tests and scoring, examinations have stood as the backbone of the education industry. Teaching faculty spend an enormous amount of time for verification and assigning the right scores to each student. This acts as a limitation as the faculty can focus on other aspects of teaching and enriching the students. The Application focuses on a novel methodology to automate the correction for subjective-based questions and answers using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Techniques.</p>
